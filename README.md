# Cyber-warrior

A single page workout tracker built with React and TailwindCSS. The
application runs entirely in the browser so it can be hosted directly
through GitHub Pages.

To view the site locally open `index.html` in your browser. When
pushing to GitHub enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings and
point it at the `main` branch to publish the site.

## v1.1 Update

Version 1.1 introduces the secondary currency **C-Creds**, the `//BLACK_MARKET` screen, and the `//DEFRAG` rest period minigame. Your current balance is shown in the header and can be spent on consumables via the market. Breakthrough sets and flawless mission completions grant C-Creds. A simple version identifier is displayed in the UI footer.

## v1.3 - "Firewall"
The "Defrag" minigame has been replaced with **FIREWALL**, an ASCII shooter accessed during rest periods. Consumables from the //BLACK_MARKET now provide effects like the Overclock.exe XP boost.
