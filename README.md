# Cyber-warrior

A single page workout tracker built with React and TailwindCSS. The
application runs entirely in the browser so it can be hosted directly
through GitHub Pages.

To view the site locally open `index.html` in your browser. When
pushing to GitHub enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings and
point it at the `main` branch to publish the site.
