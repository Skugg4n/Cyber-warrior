AEGIS Protocol: Advanced Reward System
Part 1: Full Explanation - The Two-Currency Economy
To properly reward both raw effort and strategic engagement, we will expand the AEGIS economy to include two distinct forms of currency:

DATA_PACKETS (XP): This remains the foundation of your Operator's progression. You earn XP primarily through physical outputâ€”the total volume of weight lifted and reps completed. Its sole purpose is to increase your Operator Level, unlocking more challenging directives and passive system upgrades. XP is a direct measure of your power and cannot be bought or traded.

C-Creds (Cyber Credits): This is the new strategic currency. C-Creds are not earned from raw effort, but by demonstrating efficiency, consistency, and problem-solving. Think of them as the currency of the digital underworld within the AEGIS Mainframe. You earn them by being a smart and dedicated Operator, and you spend them to gain tactical advantages and unique customizations.

This two-currency system ensures that while the core path to power is through the hard work of exercise (XP), a deeper level of engagement is rewarded with a flexible currency (C-Creds) that allows for personalization and strategic planning.

Part 2: Detailed Breakdown - Earning and Spending C-Creds
This new system introduces new ways to be rewarded and a new place to spend those rewards.

How to Earn C-Creds
You acquire C-Creds by going above and beyond the basic requirements of a directive.

Performance Optimization (Beating Your PRs): When you complete a set that surpasses your "previous" record, the system flags it as a PERFORMANCE_BREAKTHROUGH and rewards a small amount of C-Creds.

Streak Calibration (Consistency is Key): Completing workouts on a 3-day or 7-day streak awards bonus C-Creds.

Directive Efficiency (Flawless Execution): Completing every target set for every exercise in a directive awards a C-Cred bonus.

Solving System Glitches (Unique Events): Special [GLITCHED] directives on the message board offer large C-Cred payouts.

How to Spend C-Creds: The //BLACK_MARKET
C-Creds can be spent in a new section of the app, accessed via the main menu: [4] //BLACK_MARKET. This is a hidden shop run by anonymous data brokers.

Schematics & Cosmetics: The primary use for C-Creds. The Black Market offers exclusive AUGMENT schematics for your Operator Profile, all rendered in detailed ASCII art.

Examples: CHASSIS_CHROMA_PACK (changes text color theme), HOLOTAG_EMITTER (a custom ASCII art symbol next to your name), STARTUP_SEQUENCE_v2.1 (a custom boot-up text animation).

Data Decryption Keys: Purchase keys to unlock [REDACTED] information on the message board, revealing lore or secret missions.

Single-Use Tactical Programs (Consumables): Purchase temporary boosts like Overclock.exe (XP multiplier) or Glitch_Filter.pak (streak protection).

Part 3: Active System Engagement - Rest Period Minigames
To transform rest periods from downtime into active engagement, a timed minigame becomes available between sets.

Activation: After logging a set, a rest timer (e.g., 90 seconds) begins. A prompt appears: > SYSTEM IDLE. INITIATE //DEFRAG? [Y/N]

The Minigame: //DEFRAG

Concept: A simple, ASCII-based "Asteroids" style game. Your cursor is a ship ^. Fragmented data blocks # and corrupted packets * drift across the screen.

Gameplay: You move your ship and "fire" a laser | to destroy the fragments. The game is designed to be played in short, intense bursts.

Goal: Destroy as many fragments as possible before the rest timer expires.

Cut-off: When the timer hits zero, the game screen immediately vanishes and is replaced with: > REST PERIOD COMPLETE. RESUME DIRECTIVE. This hard cut-off is crucial to keep the focus on the workout.

The Reward:

Your score in //DEFRAG is converted into a small amount of C-Creds.

This creates a compelling loop: work out, play a game to earn tactical currency, use that currency to get advantages for your next workout. It makes the rest period a valuable part of the session.
